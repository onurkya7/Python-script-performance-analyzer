# Performance testing for python code

## Explanation of the code
Performs cpu, ram and runtime performance tests on your python code.
- cpu shown as percentile
- ram is measured in mb type
- runtime measurement in seconds

Important information: 
- In codes with very small runtime, results may be incomplete, but for codes that run 2-3 seconds above, it shows realistic results. However, multiple tests are recommended to obtain accurate results.

## How to use?

- just paste your code between the place shown.
